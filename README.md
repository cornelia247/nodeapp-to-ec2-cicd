# Todo List App CI/CD Guide ðŸš€

Welcome to the Todo List App CI/CD Guide, where we'll walk you through setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for your app.

## Prerequisites

- **GitHub Account**: You need a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can sign up at [github.com](https://github.com).
- **Docker Hub Account**: You also need a Docker Hub account. If you don't have one, sign up at [hub.docker.com](https://hub.docker.com).
- **Server with Docker**: Ensure your server has Docker installed. If not, you can follow instructions [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) to get it up and running.

## CI/CD Workflow

## Instructions

1. **Set Up the Basics**:
   - Fork this repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Secrets for Secure Deployment**:
   - Go to your repository's settings and add two secrets:
     - `DOCKER_USERNAME`: Your Docker Hub username.
     - `DOCKER_PASSWORD`: Your Docker Hub password or access token.

3. **Get Ready to Deploy**:
   - Make sure Docker is installed on your server.
   - Configure your server to route traffic to the app, using Nginx or a reverse proxy of your choice.

4. **Setting Up a GitHub Runner**:
   - Enhance your CI/CD workflow by setting up a self-hosted GitHub Runner on your server.
   - Follow the detailed instructions provided by GitHub in their official documentation: [Setting up a self-hosted runner](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners).

5. **Deploy Like a Pro**:
   - Push your code to `main` and watch the CI/CD process do its thing.
   - Your app will be live on your server, updated and ready for action!
